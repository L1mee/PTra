# Ideas

## Fundamentals

  - The player is weak and not made for surving the alien planet.
  - Rather than weapons the player prefers tools.

---

## Story

Throughout the missions the player finds story elements and clues towards something special to the alien race. This is, so to say, their One Piece.

A spie contacts you to uplift the organisation.

You start to unite the workers which ultimately leads to a rebellion.

## Player abilities, tools and weapons

  - ### Stungun

    Very limited amount of ammunition, to make stun-locking enemies not a viable strategy.

  - ### Shockwire

    Inspired by Horizon: Zero Dawn a trap layed down beforehand to accomplish different kinds of effects on passing creatures.

  - ### Barrier

    Something that creatures don't want to enter/pass through.

  - ### Distraction

    Something to distract creatures to lead them in a certain direction.

  - ### TP-Bridges

    The player places down two anchors. Interacting with one of them teleports the player to the other anchor. Intended use is to prepare the bridge and then use it afterwards, not place it in a rush. That is also why an anchor requires some time to be deployed.

  - ### Flash

    Used to confuse chasing creatures that are using eyesight.

  - ### Smoke grenade

    A hiding place, unless chasing creatures saw the player enter.

  - ### Scout drone

    Inspired by R6 Siege, a way for the player to get some information on the area ahead without risking their own discovery.

  - ### Movement

    Some tools that allow the player to move in more ways than just walk. Could include diegetic bars, roles, sprints and more.

## Alien abilities

Alien specific abilities, though not every creatures can use all of these abilities.

  - ### Charge-AOE

    Charges an area of effect ability that hits the player. Animation that displays charge to allow player to get out of reach.

  - ### Scan

    Allows the creature to check for enemies, mainly used to find the player after they escaped.

  - ### Silence

    Prevents player to use certain abilities for a set amount of time.

  - ### Slimeshot

    Stuns player on hit at their current location.

  - ### Stealth

    Hides itself to surprise player and reduce predictability. Can't hide just about everywhere.

  - ### Change environment

    For example places cobwebs at their current location that makes it harder for the player to pass that area.

---

## Environment

  - ### Terrain

    - Normal
    - Tough
    - Slippery

  - ### Cover
    
    - Natural cover (bushes)
    - Line of sight (hide behind)

---

## Base

  - ### Scanner

    Displays information about the current planet.

  - ### Equipment Upgrades

  - ### Equipment Crafting

  - ### Unlocks

  - ### Skilltree

    Skills can be earned/unlocked by in-game money to limit immersion breaking as much as possible. Therefore the player won't have a level.

    - Reduce visibility
    - Increase movement speed

---

## Miscellaneous

  - ### Performance based difficulty

    AI might get better during the game and adapt to the player.

  - ### More options/brains instead of muscle

    Instead of becoming overpowered the player gets more options. The environment and obstacles still get harder though, but the main focus should be the player getting better at the game. This means no weapons that simply deal more damage.
