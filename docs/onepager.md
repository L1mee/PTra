P-Tra is a Third-Person Top-Down Exploration-Game including puzzle and stealth aspects centered on a space poacher hunting for rare alien delicacies and extraterrestrial loot. Roaming around space working for a shady organisation on their (trusty old) space ship they come across various species and landscapes. Though humanity's reputation precedes and the locals arenâ€™t exactly fond of the unknown visitor.

To balance out the dark topic P-Tra has a lot of humerous details and allusions to modern society.

## Mechanics
