## Setting

The yet to be named project plays within a dystopian future, centered around a black poaching company. The protagonist being the one in charge of carrying out dangerous missions, to retrieve specimen. They are living on a small-scale space station orbiting around a planet with several moons. With them there is also another poacher, named [Dude that dies Kenny] and a retired one named [Old Guy]. The retired one being the one overseeing the training of the others and brace them for what’s to come.
Other than them, there is also a mechanic which is in charge of keeping the station intact, a medic robot being able to keep the poachers alive after their mission and the communication station which is used to brief missions.
The missions themselves take place on the planet and moons they are orbiting around.
All characters are bound to the company by a [Chip/Slave Collar?] which can kill them if they do not obey the orders which were given.

## Environment

### Space Station

The space station is small and only able to fit the few people of the crew. As the company does not want to spend much money for such tasks, as the crew is likely to die anyway, all the equipment is either cheap or too old to function properly. The station is run down and used for decades. Before the two newcomers came, the veteran and mechanic took care of everything on their own. It is the bare minimum to keep the station running.

### Planet

The main planet was once a prime target for researchers due to its ancient ruins stemming from a long-gone civilization. Since this civilization the planet has developed a hazardous environment, which made the equipment costs too high to maintain. Now it is a prime target for poaching, as the specimen fetch high prices on the market, due to the products made from them being highly resistant to all sorts of influences.
The main fauna of the planet consists of animals with large exoskeletons, which can hardly be penetrated even with the best of equipment. The scale and danger of adult specimen makes it impossible to farm them in external facilities, which is why younger specimen and even eggs are poached and raised, ranched until they become a hazard and killed.
The flora is somewhat dense, presenting a variety of ferns, giant mushrooms, and hazardous looking flowers, comparable to carnivorous plants. They evolved due to the already dangerous environment and are therefore very hardy. The spores of the giant mushrooms intoxicate the atmosphere making it impossible for humans to breath naturally, eventually killing them.

### Style

Due to the hazardous environment and the exploration and stealth aspect of the game (see below), a darker eerie style would be fitting, as this creates an atmosphere where hiding feels important.


## Gameplay

The game is set to be in a complete top-down perspective. The main aspect of the game is to explore the planet, complete given missions and finding lore on the planet, left by other poachers and the ancient civilization. The narrative is therefore presented through the exploration and interaction with the other crew members on the station.
The player can interact with the communication console to receive its mission and be sent to the planet via a transport pot.

### Exploration

The exploration is split into two parts.
The first being the tracking of the mission goal. One must find clues to the monsters or nests location. These clues consist of tracks, ruffed flora or fauna or excrements left behind. They then give information, in which the direction the next clue or goal lies. Following them will lead to the goal, which can be picked up and brought back to the station.
The second one being the lore left behind, which can be ruins of the ancient civilization or dead poachers which failed with their mission.
While being on the plant, only the main environment is also displayed. Everything else, which are the interactable objects and other important level assets are hidden within a fog of war.
The player can use a flashlight or set up a pole which illuminates in a cone or radius respectively, uncovering the mentioned objects.
Interactable objects are also marked so that the player does not have to walk against every possible object. 

### Stealth

The exploration includes working with the monsters present. As they are not enemies the player could fight, the only option is to hide or distract it. There are the types of monsters which can recognize you by sound and those that do by vision.
Hiding means that the player must turn off his flashlight as that would give him away or stand still so that they are not being heard. The player needs to find out, in what intervals the monster comes by, so that they can reach desired clues and goals or distract them to find an opening.
Being found out means that the player needs to run and shake the monster off, by taking corners or going into places where the monster can’t. Being caught means death and game over. The player is then placed within the space station and needs to restart the mission.

### Upgrading

On board of the basis the player can upgrade their equipment with help of the mechanic. Upgrades range from increased stats (eg. faster movement speed) to consumeables and items. Their cost/requirement is based on resources, money and story progress where the player might unlock blueprints.

Further ideas for upgrades include:
  - better movement
  - less noise
  - advanced tools
  - increased inventory space
  - more range on some abilities
  - more "ammunition"
  - ...

*This won't be part of our proof of concept.*
