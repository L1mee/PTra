P-Tra is a Third-Person Top-Down **Exploration-Game** including puzzle and stealth aspects centered on a space poacher hunting for rare alien [delicacies] and extraterrestrial loot. Roaming around space working for a shady organisation on [their trusty old] space ship they come across various species and landscapes. Though humanity's reputation precedes and the locals arenâ€™t exactly fond of the unknown visitor.

To balance out the dark topic P-Tra has a lot of humerous details and allusions to modern society.
