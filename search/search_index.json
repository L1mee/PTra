The main fauna of the planet consists of animals with large exoskeletons, which can hardly be penetrated even with the best of equipment. The scale and danger of adult specimen makes it impossible to farm them in external facilities, which is why younger specimen and even eggs are poached and raised, ranched until they become a hazard and killed. The flora is somewhat dense, presenting a variety of ferns, giant mushrooms, and hazardous looking flowers, comparable to carnivorous plants. They evolved due to the already dangerous environment and are therefore very hardy. The spores of the giant mushrooms intoxicate the atmosphere making it impossible for humans to breath naturally, eventually killing them.</p>"},{"location":"Game%20Design/hlv/#style","title":"Style","text":"<p>Due to the hazardous environment and the exploration and stealth aspect of the game (see below), a darker eerie style would be fitting, as this creates an atmosphere where hiding feels important.</p>"},{"location":"Game%20Design/hlv/#gameplay","title":"Gameplay","text":"<p>The game is set to be in a complete top-down perspective.

The player needs to find out, in what intervals the monster comes by, so that they can reach desired clues and goals or distract them to find an opening.

Power cells emit a steady pulse that runs through the linked systems. Levers then convert the impuls to an action, when linked to a door this can be either open or close, the state of the door itself does not require any power. This changes per linked object, some objects need constant power to maintain their state. Since this system is running on impulse the conservation of momentum (Impulserhaltung) dictates that only the last-linked system is powered. This only applies to \"work\" being done, so a turned-on lever linked to an open door is not considered to \"use up\" that impulse.</p> <p>(They can be separated into two categories: Impulse and constant power. More categories might be added in the future)</p> <p>Since this impulse system is different from electricity no circuit is required. Instead of parallel connections the signal is simply split up, with both ends being considered for \"last-linked\". However different machines/actions might require stronger impulses, a split only provides each side with exactly half impulse power. Some machines simply won't run properly under these cirumstances. This can easily be achieved by adding an additional impulse cell to the entire circuit. Whenever there are two impulse cells on the same line the last two systems are powered. A split always splits in two lines, so there are only ever power states of 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and less. Power states above 1 are always rounded down visually and only internally processed as a higher number. Lower power states are shown with a weaker impulse.</p> <p>The first obstacle: A nice introduction to alien technology is a very basic door with a powercell and a lever. The player needs to put back the powercell and flip the lever to get through the door. Levers stay in their last position no matter the power, so the sequence is not important here.</p> <p>(This might open potential mechanics for overloading the system that then forcefully flicks the lever by overloading)</p> <p>More advanced obstacle: Multiple power cells are required in a two-stage puzzle. The first challenge is getting through to the first additional impulse cell that then opens a pathway to the second stage that makes use of both impulse cells.</p> <p>Attributes</p> <ul> <li>Impulse cell: Generates impulses</li> <li>Series connection</li> <li>Parallel connection</li> <li>Door (Impulse power): Opens pathway</li> <li>Restoration device (Constant power): Creates new pathways</li> <li>Dropper (IP): Drops an item/device</li> <li>Bridge (CP): Transfers impulse to a different location</li> <li>Lights (CP): Lights up a previously unlit area, highlighting a code or something useful previously invisible</li> <li>Moving elements (CP): Moving pathways</li> <li>Distraction (IP/CP): A noise or something used to distract enemies</li> <li>Custom effects (IP/CP): Whatever else might work in the area</li> <li>Piston (IP/CP): Push forward once per impulse, might clear a previously blocked lever</li> <li>Motor (CP): Powers something that requires a motor to run</li> <li>Overload: Forces a system running on IP to switch states</li> <li>Lever: Switches state of the attached machine</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Game%20Design/ideas/#more-ideas","title":"More ideas","text":"<p>Contributing the impulse could be part of the puzzle too.</p>"},{"location":"Game%20Design/ideas/#other-puzzle-ideas","title":"Other puzzle ideas","text":"<p>Underlying mechanic: Sudoku based puzzle where different symbols/objects need to be aligned.</p> <p>However this is outside of the usual 9x9 grid and instead only focusses on finding a few specific pieces for one tiny scenario.</p>"},{"location":"Game%20Design/onepager/","title":"OnePager","text":"<p>P-Tra is a Third-Person Top-Down Exploration-Game including puzzle and stealth aspects centered on a space poacher hunting for rare alien [delicacies] and extraterrestrial loot.
